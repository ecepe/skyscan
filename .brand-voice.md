## 🔵 Voice Attributes

| Trait          | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Confident**  | We know what we're doing. We speak clearly and without fluff. No jargon for the sake of sounding smart. |
| **Helpful**    | We explain things in a way that makes users feel empowered, not confused. |
| **Minimalist** | Fewer words, more value. No filler. We say just enough to guide action. |
| **Security-Minded** | We're vigilant but never alarmist. We don't hype fear — we enable awareness and control. |
| **Builder-friendly** | We speak to engineers, devs, analysts — people who want to plug it in and get results. |

## 🧠 Example Language

- **Do say:**  
  - “Scan your cloud. Catch known threats. Instantly.”  
  - “Matched against real threat feeds. No noise.”  
  - “SkyScan checks your IPs against CISA, AbuseIPDB, and GreyNoise in real time.”

- **Don’t say:**  
  - “We leverage next-gen zero-trust ML-enhanced cyber defense paradigms…”  
  - “The platform provides unparalleled…” (too buzzwordy)

## ✍️ Writing Style

- Use **short sentences** and **strong verbs**
- Prefer **active voice** (“SkyScan checks…”)  
- Avoid **vague adjectives** (“powerful”, “next-gen”) unless they’re proven
- When writing docs, use the **“You”** voice:  
  - “You can upload your IPs…” not “The user is able to…”
